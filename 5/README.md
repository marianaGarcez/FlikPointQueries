## Outlier Detection in Vessel Movement
It is a spatiotemporal anomaly detection query. To answer it, we identify anomalous vessel movements based on deviation from typical paths or speeds \cite{OutlierGeo}. This query requires historical data analysis to determine movement patterns and then detect outliers that significantly differ from these patterns.
